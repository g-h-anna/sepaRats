## Abstract

Identity tracking and instance segmentation are crucial in several areas of biological research. Behavior analysis of individuals in groups of similar animals is a task that emerges frequently in agriculture or pharmaceutical studies, among others. Automated annotation of many hours of surveillance videos can facilitate a large number of biological studies/experiments, which otherwise would not be feasible. Solutions based on machine learning generally perform well in tracking and instance segmentation; however, in the case of identical, unmarked instances (e.g., white rats or mice), even state-of-the-art approaches can frequently fail. We propose a pipeline of deep generative models for identity tracking and instance segmentation of highly similar instances, which, in contrast to most region-based approaches, exploits edge information and consequently helps to resolve ambiguity in heavily occluded cases. Our method is trained by synthetic data generation techniques, not requiring prior human annotation. We show that our approach greatly outperforms other state-of-the-art unsupervised methods in identity tracking and instance segmentation of unmarked rats in real-world laboratory video recordings
